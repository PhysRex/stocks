## The Skill Stack You Need to Build

Trading profitability comes from mastering five interconnected skills:

```
                    ┌─────────────────┐
                    │   CONSISTENCY   │  ← The goal

                    ┌────────┴────────┐
                    │  MARKET KNOWLEDGE│  ← Foundation
                    └─────────────────┘
```

Most traders fail because they skip to "strategy" without building the foundation.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-6)

### Goal: Understand markets deeply before risking real money

### Month 1-2: Market Mechanics

**Study:**
- How orders work (market, limit, stop, stop-limit)
- Bid/ask spread and liquidity
- How market makers operate
- Pre-market and after-hours trading
- Options basics (calls, puts, Greeks)
- Futures basics (contracts, margin, rollover)

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Open a paper trading account (ThinkorSwim, TradingView)
- [ ] Watch the market open for 30 minutes daily
- [ ] Document what you observe (patterns, behavior, news reactions)
- [ ] Read: *A Beginner's Guide to the Stock Market* - Matthew Kratter

**Time Commitment:** 1-2 hours/day

### Month 2-3: Chart Reading

**Study:**
- Candlestick patterns (focus on 5-10 high-probability patterns)
- Support and resistance (the most important concept)
- Trend identification (higher highs/lows, lower highs/lows)
- Volume analysis (confirmation, divergence)
- Key moving averages (20, 50, 200 day)

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Analyze 10 charts per day (mark S/R, trends, patterns)
- [ ] Backtest patterns manually (look at 100 historical examples)
- [ ] Start a chart analysis journal
- [ ] Read: *Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets* - John Murphy (chapters 1-10)

**Key Insight:** You're not looking for "secret patterns." You're learning to read supply and demand visually.

### Month 3-4: Strategy Exploration

**Study different approaches:**

| Strategy Type | Holding Period | Win Rate | Risk/Reward |
|--------------|----------------|----------|-------------|
| Scalping | Seconds-minutes | 60-70% | 1:1 |
| Day trading | Minutes-hours | 45-55% | 2:1 |
| Swing trading | Days-weeks | 40-50% | 3:1 |
| Position trading | Weeks-months | 35-45% | 4:1+ |

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Paper trade each style for 1 week
- [ ] Track which fits your personality and schedule
- [ ] Identify 2-3 setups that make intuitive sense to you
- [ ] Read: *How to Day Trade for a Living* - Andrew Aziz

**Critical Question:** Which style fits your life? Day trading requires screen time during market hours. Swing trading can be done with 30 min/day evenings.

### Month 4-6: Paper Trading Intensive

**Goal:** Execute 100+ paper trades with strict rules

**Rules:**
1. Define entry criteria BEFORE the trade
2. Set stop loss BEFORE entering
3. Set profit target BEFORE entering
4. Risk exactly 1% per trade (no more, no less)
5. Journal every trade (screenshot, reasoning, outcome, lessons)

**Tracking Sheet:**

| Date | Symbol | Setup | Entry | Stop | Target | Result | R Multiple | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|-------|------|--------|--------|------------|-------|
| 1/15 | AAPL | Pullback to 20MA | $182 | $179 | $188 | Win | +2R | Held full target |
| 1/16 | MSFT | Breakout | $415 | $410 | $425 | Loss | -1R | Fakeout, noted pattern |

**Metrics to Track:**
- Win rate (target: 40-50% for swing, 50-60% for day trading)
- Average R multiple (target: 1.5-2.0)
- Expectancy = (Win% × Avg Win) - (Loss% × Avg Loss)
- Largest drawdown
- Longest losing streak

**Milestone:** 100 trades with positive expectancy before moving to real money.

---

## Phase 2: Real Money Introduction (Months 6-12)

### Goal: Prove your edge with real money, small size

### Account Setup

**Recommended starting allocation of your $10K:**

| Purpose | Amount | Platform |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Swing trading | $5,000 | Robinhood/Webull |
| Micro futures | $2,500 | NinjaTrader/Tradovate |
| Options practice | $1,500 | TastyTrade |
| Emergency buffer | $1,000 | Savings (don't trade this) |

### Position Sizing Rules

**The 1% Rule:** Never risk more than 1% of account on a single trade.

```
Account: $5,000
Max risk per trade: $50
If stop loss is $2 from entry: Position size = 25 shares
If stop loss is $5 from entry: Position size = 10 shares
```

**The 5% Rule:** Never have more than 5% of account at risk across all open positions.

### Monthly Goals (Months 6-12)

| Month | Focus | Target |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 6 | Execute 20 real trades following rules | Don't blow up |
| 7 | Refine one strategy, drop others | Find your edge |
| 8 | Increase consistency | Win rate within 5% of paper trading |
| 9 | Handle first real drawdown | Psychological test |
| 10 | Begin tracking advanced metrics | Sharpe, profit factor |
| 11 | First profitable month | Any profit counts |
| 12 | Review and plan year 2 | Data-driven adjustments |

### The Journal System

**Every trade gets documented:**

```markdown
## Trade #47 - NVDA Long
**Date:** 2026-03-15
**Setup:** Pullback to rising 20 EMA after earnings gap up

### Pre-Trade
- Entry: $890
- Stop: $875 (-$15 risk)
- Target: $920 (+$30 reward)
- Position size: 3 shares ($45 risk = 0.9% of account)
- R:R = 2:1

### Execution
- Actual entry: $891 (slight slippage)
- Actual exit: $912 (took partial, trailed rest)
- Result: +$21/share × 3 = +$63

### Analysis
- What went right: Patient entry, waited for confirmation
- What went wrong: Took profit too early, ran to $935
- Lesson: Use trailing stop instead of fixed target
- Grade: B+
```

### Red Flags to Watch

**Stop trading and reassess if:**
- [ ] You lose 10% of account in a month
- [ ] You break position sizing rules
- [ ] You hold losers hoping they'll recover
- [ ] You average down on losing positions
- [ ] You trade out of boredom or revenge
- [ ] Your win rate drops 15%+ below paper trading

---

## Phase 3: Edge Refinement (Year 2)

### Goal: Develop a proven, repeatable edge

### What Is an Edge?

An edge is a statistical advantage that produces positive expectancy over many trades.

**Expectancy Formula:**
```
Expectancy = (Win Rate × Average Win) - (Loss Rate × Average Loss)

Example:
Win Rate: 45%
Average Win: $200 (2R)
Loss Rate: 55%
Average Loss: $100 (1R)

Expectancy = (0.45 × $200) - (0.55 × $100) = $90 - $55 = +$35 per trade
```

If your expectancy is positive over 100+ trades, you have an edge.

### Specialization

**Stop being a generalist. Become an expert in ONE area:**

| Specialization | What to Master |
|----------------|----------------|
| **Momentum breakouts** | Volume patterns, relative strength, sector rotation |
| **Mean reversion** | Oversold bounces, Bollinger Bands, RSI extremes |
| **Trend following** | Moving average systems, trailing stops, position building |
| **Options selling** | Theta decay, IV rank, probability of profit |
| **Futures scalping** | Order flow, DOM reading, market profile |

**Pick one. Get really good at it. Add others later.**

### Building Your Playbook

Create a written document for each setup you trade:

```markdown
## Setup: 20/50 EMA Pullback (Long)

### Market Conditions Required
- SPY above 20 and 50 EMA (bull market)
- VIX below 25 (low fear)

### Stock Criteria
- Above 200 EMA (long-term uptrend)
- Made new 20-day high in last 5 days
- Pulled back to 20 EMA (±1%)
- Volume declining on pullback

### Entry Trigger
- First green candle off 20 EMA
- Volume above average

### Stop Loss
- Below 50 EMA or swing low (whichever is closer)
- Maximum 3% from entry

### Profit Targets
- Target 1: Prior high (take 50%)
- Target 2: 2× risk (take 25%)
- Target 3: Trail with 10 EMA (final 25%)

### Position Size
- Risk 1% of account
- Calculate shares: (Account × 0.01) / (Entry - Stop)

### Historical Stats (100+ trades)
- Win rate: 47%
- Average winner: 2.3R
- Average loser: 0.9R
- Expectancy: +0.65R per trade
- Best market condition: Steady uptrend
- Worst market condition: Choppy/range-bound
```

### Year 2 Quarterly Goals

| Quarter | Goal | Metric |
|---------|------|--------|
| Q1 | Document 3 setups with 50+ trades each | Positive expectancy on all 3 |
| Q2 | Eliminate weakest setup, double down on best | Improve best setup's stats |
| Q3 | Add market regime filter | Avoid trading in bad conditions |
| Q4 | First attempt at prop firm evaluation | Pass or learn from failure |

### Capital Growth Targets (Conservative)

| Month | Account | Monthly % | Monthly $ |
|-------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Start of Year 2 | $10,000 | - | - |
| After Q1 | $11,500 | +5%/mo avg | +$500/mo |
| After Q2 | $13,200 | +5%/mo avg | +$575/mo |
| After Q3 | $15,200 | +5%/mo avg | +$665/mo |
| After Q4 | $17,500 | +5%/mo avg | +$765/mo |

**Note:** 5%/month is aggressive but achievable. Many months will be flat or negative. Consistency matters more than home runs.

---

## Phase 4: Scaling Up (Year 3)

### Goal: Increase size while maintaining edge

### The Scaling Challenge

Most traders can make money with small size but blow up when scaling. Why?

1. **Psychology changes** - Losing $500 feels different than losing $50
2. **Market impact** - Larger orders move price against you
3. **Overconfidence** - Success leads to rule-breaking
4. **Risk creep** - Gradually increasing position sizes too fast

### Safe Scaling Rules

**The 50% Rule:** Only increase position size after 50 consecutive trades maintaining your edge.

**The Step-Up Method:**
```
Level 1: Risk $50/trade (prove edge over 50 trades)
Level 2: Risk $75/trade (prove over 50 trades)
Level 3: Risk $100/trade (prove over 50 trades)
Level 4: Risk $150/trade (prove over 50 trades)
...continue...
```

**The Drawdown Reset:** If you hit 10% drawdown, drop back one level until you recover.

### Prop Firm Strategy (Year 3 Priority)

By Year 3, you should have:
- 18+ months of live trading data
- Positive expectancy proven over 200+ trades
- Defined playbook with 2-3 setups
- Psychological resilience tested

**Prop Firm Attempt Schedule:**

| Attempt | Firm | Account Size | Cost | Approach |
|---------|------|--------------|------|----------|
| 1 | TopStep | $50K | $165/mo | Conservative, hit minimum days |
| 2 | Apex | $50K | $147 | Slightly more aggressive |
| 3 | FTMO | $100K | $540 | If futures attempts fail, try forex |

**Evaluation Strategy:**
1. Trade at 50% of your normal size for first week
2. Build a cushion (get to +3% before increasing size)
3. Never risk more than 0.5% per trade during evaluation
4. Focus on consistency, not speed
5. If down 3%, reduce size dramatically

### Year 3 Income Projection

**Scenario A: Prop Funded**
```
Prop Account: $100,000
Monthly Return: 3%
Gross Profit: $3,000
Your Share (85%): $2,550/month = $30,600/year

Personal Account: $25,000
Monthly Return: 4%
Profit: $1,000/month = $12,000/year

Total Year 3 Income: ~$42,000
```

**Scenario B: Personal Account Only**
```
Personal Account: $30,000
Monthly Return: 4%
Profit: $1,200/month = $14,400/year

(Plus day job income - don't quit yet)
```

---

## Phase 5: Professional Transition (Years 4-5)

### Goal: Reach $100K/year income from trading

### The Math to $100K

| Path | Capital Needed | Monthly Return | Monthly Income |
|------|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| Personal only | $250,000 | 3.5% | $8,750 |
| Prop only | $400,000 | 2.5% @ 85% split | $8,500 |
| Hybrid (recommended) | $100K personal + $200K prop | 3% each | $9,100 |

### Hybrid Model (Most Realistic)

```
Personal Account: $100,000
- Monthly return: 3%
- Monthly profit: $3,000

Prop Account: $200,000
- Monthly return: 3%
- Gross: $6,000
- Your share (85%): $5,100

Total Monthly: $8,100
Annual: $97,200

Scale to $100K by either:
- Growing personal to $110K, OR
- Getting funded with $250K prop account, OR
- Improving returns to 3.2%
```

### Pre-Transition Checklist

**Do NOT quit your job until:**

- [ ] 24 consecutive months of profitability
- [ ] Average monthly return > 2.5% over 24 months
- [ ] Maximum drawdown < 15% in any month
- [ ] 12 months living expenses saved (separate from trading capital)
- [ ] Health insurance solution (spouse, marketplace, etc.)
- [ ] Prop funding secured OR $75K+ personal capital
- [ ] Spouse/family buy-in (if applicable)
- [ ] Tax strategy established (quarterly estimates, entity structure)
- [ ] Trading income > 80% of current job income for 6+ months

### The Lifestyle

**Daily Routine (Full-Time Trader):**

```
5:30 AM  - Wake up, exercise
6:30 AM  - Review overnight news, futures, premarket
7:30 AM  - Build watchlist, set alerts
9:30 AM  - Market open (high focus)
11:30 AM - Reduced activity, lunch
1:30 PM  - Afternoon session (if trading)
4:00 PM  - Market close, journal trades
5:00 PM  - Review, study, next day prep
6:00 PM  - Done for the day
```

**Reality Check:**
- Many days are boring (waiting for setups)
- Losing streaks are psychologically brutal
- No colleagues, no water cooler, no separation of work/home
- Income is variable (some months negative)
- You need discipline without a boss

## The Skills Nobody Talks About

### 1. Patience

90% of trading is waiting. You'll watch the market for hours with no valid setup. The pros wait. The amateurs force trades.

**Exercise:** Spend one week where you can ONLY take trades that match your playbook exactly. No exceptions. Count how many "almost" setups you skip.

### 2. Accepting Losses

Losses are not failures. They're business expenses. A surgeon doesn't quit after losing a patient. A trader doesn't quit after losing a trade.

**Reframe:** "I didn't lose $100. I paid $100 for information about my strategy and the market."

### 3. Emotional Regulation

The market will test every emotional weakness:
- Fear (cutting winners early)
- Greed (holding losers, oversizing)
- Revenge (trading angry after a loss)
- Euphoria (overconfidence after wins)
- FOMO (chasing moves you missed)

**Exercise:** After any trade that triggers emotion, take a 15-minute break before the next trade. Journal the emotion.

### 4. Boredom Tolerance

The best traders are bored most of the time. If trading is exciting, you're doing it wrong.

**Sign of progress:** You feel nothing when taking a loss because you know it's part of the process.

### 5. Continuous Improvement

Markets evolve. What worked in 2024 may not work in 2027. You must:
- Review your trades weekly
- Adjust strategies quarterly
- Learn new techniques yearly
- Stay humble always

## Common Failure Points (And How to Avoid Them)

| Failure Point | When It Happens | How to Avoid |
|--------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Blowing up account | Months 6-12 | Strict 1% risk rule, no exceptions |
| Quitting too early | After first drawdown | Expected. Part of process. Keep going. |
| Overcomplicating | Year 1-2 | One strategy, one market, one timeframe |
| Scaling too fast | Year 2-3 | 50-trade rule between size increases |
| Quitting job too early | Year 3-4 | 24-month profitability requirement |
| Lifestyle inflation | Year 4-5 | Keep expenses low, reinvest profits |

---

## Year-by-Year Summary

| Year | Focus | Account Target | Monthly Income |
|------|-------|----------------|----------------|
| 1 | Learn, paper trade, small real trades | $10K → $12K | $0 (still learning) |
| 2 | Develop edge, build playbook | $12K → $25K | $0-500 (supplemental) |
| 3 | Scale, attempt prop funding | $25K → $50K + prop | $1,000-2,500 |
| 4 | Professional development | $50K → $80K + prop | $3,000-5,000 |
| 5 | Full transition possible | $80K+ + prop | $6,000-10,000 |

**Year 5 Target: $100K/year = ~$8,300/month**

Achievable with $100K personal @ 3% + $200K prop @ 3% (85% split)

---

## Final Thoughts

The path from $10K to $100K/year income takes 3-5 years because you're not just growing capital—you're building skills that take thousands of hours to develop.

**The shortcut everyone wants doesn't exist.**

But the path is real. Every successful trader walked it. They:

1. Started small and survived the learning phase
2. Developed one edge and mastered it
3. Scaled slowly while maintaining discipline
4. Used prop capital to accelerate growth
5. Transitioned only when financially ready

You have the capital to start. Now you need the patience to finish.

The question isn't whether $100K/year is possible—it clearly is for the 1-3% who succeed.

The question is: **Are you willing to do the work that 97% of people won't do?**
